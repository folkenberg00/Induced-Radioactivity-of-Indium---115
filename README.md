# Induced-Radioactivity-of-Indium---115
The most common natural isotope of Indium is Indium -115. In the event this stable isotope is subjected to neutron activation to an unstable radionuclide of the same element(Indium -116), it shifts from the stability track and disintegrates spontaneously in an attempt to attain a stable configuration. This simple program processes raw data from this activity and gives a summary of the desired output. It is simply a quick way of assessing the validity of lab data of the same process before attempting to sequentially compute the required output for compiling a comprehensive report. 
The decay constant is indirectly measured in order to determine the half-life of Indium - 116 after considering the measurements of the decrease in the activity of the sample over a period of time. It is with the decay constant that the half-life of indium and associated absolute uncertainties in measurements are computed.

It is also important that the degree of reliability of the retrieved parameters is assessed. This assessment is done using the computed test criterion.

This program runs on Python3 IDLE.
