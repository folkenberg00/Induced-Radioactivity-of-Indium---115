# Induced-Radioactivity-of-Indium---115
The most common natural isotope of Indium is Indium -115. In the event this stable isotope is subjected to neutron activation to an unstable radionuclide of the same element(Indium -116), it shifts from the stability track and disintegrates spontaneously in an attempt to attain a stable configuration. This simple program processes raw data from this activity and gives a summary of the desired output. It is simply a quick way of assessing the validity of lab data of the same process before attempting to sequentially compute the required output for compiling a comprehensive report.
